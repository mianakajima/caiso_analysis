## Notes on pricing


- Locational Marginal Pricing
  - [Renewable Energy in Power Markets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/locational-marginal-pricing)
    - With no transmission line constraints or losses, LMP would be the same at every node with the cheapest generation being used first.
    - LMP = Marginal cost of energy + Marginal cost of congestion + Marginal loss component
  - [CAISO Expanded Metering Report](http://www.caiso.com/Documents/DraftFinalProposal_ExpandedMetering_TelemetryOptionsPhase2_DistributedEnergyResourceProvider.pdf)
    - A sub-LAP is an ISO defined subset of pricing nodes (see next footnote) within a default LAP. A default
LAP is the LAP defined for the transmission access charge area at which all bids for demand shall be
submitted and settled, except as provided in tariff sections 27.2.1 and 30.5.3.2.
    - A pricing node or “PNode” is a single network node or subset of network nodes where a physical
injection or withdrawal is modeled and for which a locational marginal price is calculated and used for
financial settlements. 
  - [2018 US DOE Renewable Energy Grid Integration Data Book](https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy20osti/74823.pdf)
    - LMP is "marginal cost of supplying, at least cost, the next increment of electric demand at a specific location (node) on the electric power network, considering both supply (generation/import) bids and demand (load/export) offers and the physical aspects of the electric system, including transmission and other operational constraints"
